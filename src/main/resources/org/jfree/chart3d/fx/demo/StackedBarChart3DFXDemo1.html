            A stacked bar chart.  Note that a data series can define values
            for all rows and columns or just for a subset of rows.  In this
            example, each series adds values to a single row only.  The API
            makes it straightforward to choose which rows in the dataset 
            should be populated (in the example, series 1 occupies row 1 on
            its own, series 2 and 3 occupy the second row, and series 4 and
            5 occupy the third row).
